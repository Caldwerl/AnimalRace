This script runs a race between two contestants.

The contestants consist of objects of the custom Animal type.

They have 4 variables:
name
speed
focus
position

The race consists of a function call with 3 inputs:
contestant1 object
contestant2 object
distance

A while loop runs until one of the contestants position is greater
than or equal to the race distance.

The results are output depending on which contestant has
gone past the input distance. A unique message will display in case of a tie.
Otherwise the results will display the winner and the distance between them and
the loser at the time of victory.
